### Abstract

The novel coronavirus, designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been causing an ongoing pandemic worldwide. As of December 2, 2020, the virus has caused 64,844,711 global cases, and 1.5 million deaths have been reported. The common routes of transmission are contact and droplet transmission as well as airborne transmission. Even though the virus is causing deadly symptoms and is highly transmissible, no vaccine is currently available to protect against it. Therefore, we developed a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) information application to help educate the public about the virus and to provide analysis to help people make safer decisions during the pandemic. We created a Shiny app with an interactive, local COVID-19 dashboard, and informational statistical analysis. The COVID-19 dashboard contains Travis county and Texas demographic information (age, race, ethnicity, etc.) on the confirmed cases and deaths as well as interactive maps for the state of Texas with both county activity data from a google dataset and COVID-19 cases. The app also provides local behavior recommendations for individual counties, such as the best day to go shopping or to the park during the week. Finally, we present and in-depth analysis of the county-level features that explain the most variation in COVID-19 severity in the United States. 

### Introduction

COVID-19 has affected the entire globe. In the US alone, there have been almost 300,000 deaths from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Experts have predicted that it will take at least until the end of 2021 for global life to return to "normal" [1]("https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fauci-and-other-experts-debate-when-our-covid-19-lives-will-return-to-normal#3). Though global data and concerns about COVID can be overwhelming, it is important that each person stays educated on their local COVID situation. This was the motivation behind creating our Shiny app for counties in the state of Texas. We obtained community activity data and COVID case data to create a local and accessible COVID-19 dashboard. We predicted that overall activity would show a sharp decrease at the beginning of the pandemic and then a slow increase toward normal over time. We were also interested in how COVID-19 trends appeared in urban vs. more rural Texas counties.

COVID-19 has disproportional impacts on different locations, age groups and racial groups. Understanding the local distributions of confirmed cases and deaths will get allow us to better prepare for the future and take actions to protect ourselves. Specifically, COVID-19 data demographic analysis could provide guidance for resource allocation and incoming vaccine distribution.


### Overall goals

1. Learn how to use and deploy Shiny apps with interactive graphs/maps.
2. Create a COVID-19 interactive dashboard using Shiny to gain insight into local, national, and global COVID-19 trends.
3. Generate demographic plots to explore the demographic distributions of the local confirmed cases and deaths.
4. Understand how population-level attributes influence COVID-19 severity.
5. Explore the possibilities and limitations of using publicly available COVID-19 data to perform meaningful analyses.


### Data Sources and computational methods

#### Application development:

R version 4.0 was used to generate all graphs. Tidyverse was used to clean data. The app was created and deployed using Shiny. Interactive maps were made with leaflet. Interactive graphs showing county-level activity and cases were created using ggplot. The app is stored on a shiny server.

The app is available at: https://kmaclaine.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/. Code for the app can be found at: https://github.com/alexismhill3/mol290C-COVID-dashboard

#### Data collection and analysis:

Texas county polygons were downloaded using the tigris package. Activity datasets were downloaded from google: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. COVID-19 case data was taken from the NYtimes github: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. 

COVID-19 college cases data source: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/colleges. Travis county local COVID-19 cases and demographic information data was taken from Austin-Travis County COVID-19 Dashboard Public Datasets: https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/3793562ab87e4299b106e0c282bb1fc5.

Data for the COVID-19 severity analysis was downloaded from several sources and combined using functions from the tidyverse package. Population wellness metrics (diabetes prevalence, smoking prevalence, etc.) were downloaded from the US data aggregate site https://datausa.io/. Unites States county populations and population densities were collected from the Unites States census site, https://www.census.gov/data.html. COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the NYtimes github repository cited above. The COVID-19 county principle component analysis (not appearing in the app) was performed using the base-R function `prcomp`, and plotted using `ggbiplot` from the ggbiplot package ("vqv/ggbiplot"). The linear discriminant analysis was performed using the `lda` function from the package MASS. Code for both analysis, as well as the data pre-processing code, can be found in the `scripts` directory in the application repo. 


### Results

#### Activity Data in Texas Counties

![Figure 1. Travis County Shopping and Grocery Activity](shiny_app/www/Potter_travis.png)

Overall, most counties' activity trend fowllowed a similar pattern. Activity dropped during the first few weeks of the pandemic and then increased. More urban and populated counties tended not to return to normal activity levels after the drop, while less populated counties tended to see activity return to normal levels, especially in the grocery category (Figure 1A). An example of this is shown in figure 1A, comparing Travis county, which is more urban, to Potter county, which is more rural.

Each day of the week was averaged over the last 4 weeks in the dataset. Friday showed the higheset activity score and Monday showed the lowest in grocery and shopping categories in Travis county. In Potter county, Thursday had the highest activity score in both counties, while Wednesday and Monday had the lowest activity scores for shopping and grocery respectively (Figure 1A).

Another result from this dataset is the difference in state-wide response in the categories of grocery and shopping. The shopping/restaurant activity started out at baseline pre-COVID19 and decreased as the pandemic set-in. The grocery activity started out at baseline pre-COVID19, took a huge activity spike at the onset of the pandemic (we believe we have visualized the toilet paper shortage), then went below baseline as the pandemic set in (Figure 2).


### Local COVID-19 Demographic and County-level Plots**

COVID-19 is reported to have been disproportionally affecting the minority and the elderly groups. Knowing the trend of case and death distributions can provide guidance for public health practices as well as guidance for vaccine and resource distribution. Therefore, in this section, we aim to use both nation-wide and Texas local public datasets to analyze COVID-19 case and death distributions among different locations, racial and ethnic groups and age groups. Nation-wide, as of the end of November, we see the highest death confirmed case per capita of 5.87% in Louisiana, and the highest death per capita in New York and New Jersey at over 0.37%. Texas ranks the 24th (from high to low) for total confirmed cases per capita nation-wide, and the 22nd (from high to low) for total deaths per capita nation-wide (Figure 2H).

Within Texas, Harris county, Dallas county and Tarrant have the highest number of confirmed cases by the end of November, and Travis county has the 7th highest number of cases within Texas (Figure 2E). 

We also looked at the Texas confirmed case distributions within colleges and universities by county, and our analysis shows that Lubbock county, Brazos county and Tarrant county have the highest numbers of cases from colleges and universities. Travis county has the 4th highest number of cases reported from local colleges and universities (Figure 2F). 

To take a closer look at the demographic information of the confirmed and death cases within Travis county, we analyzed data from Austin-Travis County COVID-19 Dashboard Public Datasets available online and plotted the distributions of total confirmed and death cases by age group. Based on our analysis, by the end of November, the highest number of cases falls into the younger population age between 20 to 39, but very low amount of death cases was reported within these age groups. Unlike the younger generations with relatively less pre-existing health conditions, people over 50 years old has much higher death rates as their age increases, with the group “ages 80 and up” being hit the most strongly by COVID-19 (Figure 2G). 

We also looked at the racial and ethnical distribution of local cases (Figure 2A, 2C), and we found that white people contributed to the biggest proportion of the local cases while the minorities (73%) comparing to the minoritized groups (Asian: 4%, Black: 10%, Pacific: 0%, Other: 8%). Surprisingly, Asian has 0% reported death locally, and White has 69% highest death percentage in Austin (Black: 8%, Other: 9%). 

Non-Hispanics group has slightly higher proportion of confirmed cases compared to Hispanics, and the death case proportions are relatively equal among the two groups (Figure 2B, 2D).

With all the information above, we saw that the younger generations are the main group who’s contracting and potentially spreading the disease, but the aged groups are the ones who are dying from it. Racial- and ethnic-wise, the white population are the largest population who are contracting the disease, and the proportion is close to the proportion of the White population (70.8%, Austin, TX Census Place, https://datausa.io) in Austin. Data analysis limitations in this section includes 1) the Texas college total cases analysis may be biased towards the universities that are rigorously testing and reporting the cases as there is no state-wise standards for testing and reporting among colleges and universities, and 2) it is difficult to give statistical significance conclusions on the case distribution analysis as there are no duplicates available for standard error calculation for case reporting.

### Influence of County-Level Features on COVID-19 Severity in the Unites States

![Figure 4. First Discriminant Scalar Values for Select States](shiny_app/www/lda_weights_select_states.png)

Though few communities on Earth have been spared from the COVID-19 pandemic entirely, the magnitude of epidemic severity has differed significantly between countries [2]("https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75848-2"). We reasoned that these population-level differences in COVID-19 severity should also be observable on the United States county level. Studying population-level disease severity at this scale has many advantages, including being more manageable with respect to data collection and processing. Additionally, since we can consider population-level differences on a state-by-state basis, our analysis is potentially less confounded by differences in COVID-19 policy applied at the state or national level.

We were interested to understand which county-level features explain the most variation in COVID-19 severity in the United States. To explore this further, we compiled a data set of 9 different features that could reasonably contribute to COVID-19 severity, such as diabetes prevalence, median household income, and population density. Here, we define severity as the relative disease mortality rate, i.e. the cumulative number of deaths divided by the size of the population in a given county. We model COVID-19 severity (response) as a function of our multivariate data using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (fig 3). We chose an LDA because the model weights can provide insight into which features are relatively more important for discriminating between groups. 

To test the validity of the models, we partitioned data into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). The models performed reasonably well, with prediction accuracies falling between 70%-80% for most states. We note that for states with poor prediction accuracy, such as New Hampshire (50%, with the expected random success rate being 33%), a small sample size or poor data quality may be to blame. 

Note: the following discussion may be easier to follow using the app. 

Overall, our results indicate that no single feature is the most explanatory across states, however, within different geographic regions specific patterns emerge. For example, in southern states, there was generally a strong separation due to adult smoking or adult obesity along the first discriminant axis (fig 4, Florida panel), in the expected direction (disease severity positively correlated with higher smoking/obesity prevalence). In these states, population age seems less important overall. 

In California, smoking and obesity prevalence are both strong separators (fig 4, California panel), but unexpectedly, smoking prevalence is negatively associated with COVID-19 severity. It is also interesting to note that counties with an older population appeared better off, on average, than younger counties. This pattern is also observed in Washington as well. One plausible explanation is that efforts to protect older communities in these states (both of which implemented relatively severe CODID-19 restrictions) were successful. 

Although population density did not generally appear to explain as much variance in COVID-19 severity as expected, it was one of the most important features in some states, such as Vermont (fig 4, Vermont panel). Here, we can clearly see that population density and air pollution are correlated. In Vermont, it seems that urban communities were generally worse off, while rural communities were better protected, regardless of wellness characteristics.

Finally, while the analysis provided interesting insights into COVID-19 severity in some states, results for other states were markedly less clear. In particular, models for mid-western states performed less well at separating the data and has worse prediction accuracies. One reason for this may be that in these states, the population is relatively homogeneous, and there is therefore no real difference between COVID-19 severity at the county level. Alternatively, since COVID-19 timelines between states also differ, it may be that these states are not far along enough in the pandemic for discernible patterns to emerge. 

### Conclusions

Different Texas communities showed different activity patterns during COVID-19. Urban counties in Texas seemed to be less likely to have their activity scores return to normal after the initial drop in activity, while less populated counties tended to show a better recovery in community activity.

Grocery stores showed a huge spike in activity at the onset of the pandemic, while other retail stores did not have this spike.

Younger generations are the main groups that are contracting and potentially spreading the disease, while the older population (mainly above 50) are the ones who are dying. Lubbock and Brazos counties have the highest amount of reported college and university cases. COVID-19 has disproportionately causing more deaths in the non-White population, but Asians have no reported deaths so far in Austin.

Population-level differences in COVID-19 severity can be observed at the county level, and different population level features explain more variance in different states. While each feature was most explanatory in at least one state (with the exception of Food Availability Index, which seemed the least explanatory overall) Adult Obesity Prevalence was qualitatively the most explanatory across states. The analysis conducted here helps us to better understand the population-level factors that contribute to COVID-19 severity, a disease that has caused considerable economic and emotional burden. These insights could be used to guide resource allocation during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and to help prepare for related future pandemics.
